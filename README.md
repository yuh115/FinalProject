Our team has set out to answer the question: What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh? We believe that a data-driven approach will give us a more objective and accurate answer than relying solely on subjective opinions.

To determine the best neighborhood, we developed a metric that combines several submetrics, each of which captures different aspects of what makes a neighborhood desirable. Each member of our team was responsible for analyzing a different dataset to develop their submetric, which we then combined to form our overall metric.

In this project, we analyzed three datasets: Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data, and Non-Traffic Citations. From these datasets, we extracted information on the number of fire incidents, the crime rate, and the number of non-traffic citations issued in each neighborhood.

Using these submetrics, we will develop an overall metric for determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Then We ranked each neighborhood based on this metric to determine the best neighborhood.
